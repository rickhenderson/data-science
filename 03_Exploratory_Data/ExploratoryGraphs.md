# Exploratory Graphs

## Why graphs?
To find patterns, understand the data, suggest modelling properties, debug the analyses, but not really communicate results, yet.
## Characteristics of Exploratory Graphs
* Quick
* Create many
* Don't worry about axes and legends or colour, until later
* Goal is _personal_ understanding

*Main Point: You should always have a question in mind: "Are there any counties in the U.S. that exceed that national standard for fine particle pollution?"*

## Types of Exploratory Graphs

* Five Number Summary
```R
summary(pollution$ppm25)

##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##    3.38    8.55   10.00    9.84   11.40   18.40
```
* Boxplot
```R
boxplot(pollution$ppm25, col = "blue")

# Overlaying features
boxplot(pollution$ppm25, col = "blue")
abline(h = 12)
```
* Histogram
```R
histogram(pollution$ppm25, col = "green")
rug(pollution$ppm25)

histogram(pollution$ppm25, col = "green", breaks = 100)
rug(pollution$ppm25)

# Overlaying features
hist(pollution$pm25, col = "green")
abline(v = 12, lwd = 2)
abline(v = median(pollution$pm25), col = "magenta", lwd = 4)
```
* Barplot
```R
barplot(table(pollution$region), col = "wheat", main = "Number of Counties in Each Region")
```
## Two Dimensional Plots
* Multiple / overlayed 1-D plots (Lattice / ggplot2)
* Scatterplots
* Smooth Scatterplots

## More than 2 Dimensions
* Overlayed, multiple 2-D plots, coplots
* Use color, size, and shape to add dimensions
* Spinning plots, or 3-D plots but 3D not that useful

```R
with(pollution, plot(lattitude, pm25, col = region))
abline(h = 12, lwd = 2, lty = 2)
```
