# Generate some Random data
x <- rnorm(100)
y = rnorm(100, mean = 5)


# Generate a simple scatterplot
plot(x, y, pch = 19, col = "SteelBlue")

# Generate regression line (linear model)
model <- lm(y ~x)

# Use abline to display the line on the chart
abline(model)

# Add annotations
legend("topleft", legend = "Data", pch = 19, col = "SteelBlue")
title("Random Scatterplot")

# This line needs to be modified if you are using random numbers
#text(-3, 2, "Simple Label")

# Another set of samples
s1 <- rnorm(100)
s2 <- s1 + rnorm(100)
g <- gl(2, 50, labels = c("Male", "Female"))

# Set up the plot area but don't plot anything

title("Random Scatterplot")

# Generate regression line (linear model)
model <- lm(s2 ~ s1)

# Use abline to display the line on the chart with more features
