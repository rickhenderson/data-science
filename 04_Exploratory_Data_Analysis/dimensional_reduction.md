# Dimensional Reduction

* SVD
* PCA - Principle Component Analysis

The use of __SVD__ for _singular value decomposition_ can find the groups in the data set automatically, a type of __un-supervised learning__.

* proportion of variance explained - slide 11
* the first singular value, captures the shift in the mean
  * almost 40% of the variation in your data can be explained by a single dimension
* SVD and PCA essentially calculating the same thing
* SVD essentially picks up patterns out of the data, the "truth" since not all the data points add to the pattern.
