##Week 3 - Experimental Design
* Example of great results but flawed design leading to litigation
* Have a plan for data and code sharing
* (https://github.com), (http://figshare.com) - for sharing small amounts of data with scientists
* J. Leek's Data Sharing repo

###Formulate Your Question in Advance
* A large component of data science is **statistical inference**
  * **descriptive statistics** deals with a small, randomly chosen sample, **inferential statistics** helps determine if those sample results apply to a complete **population**
* **variability**
  * low variability among test groups, big difference between test groups = good, clear result!
* **confounding**
  * ex. `age` is a _confounder_ between `shoe size` and `literacy`
* correlation is not causation
  * _spurious_ correlation - you have to prove to yourself and others that there aren't other possible variables at play

###Dealing with Confounders
####Randomization and Blocking
