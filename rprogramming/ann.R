# This is used to represent a perceptron as an S4 class.
# This works!
# Jan 21, 2016: TODO Still needs some work to get an output as well as proper instance creation.

Perceptron <- setClass(
  # Set the name for the class.
  "Perceptron",
  
  # Define the slots.
  slots <- list(
    input1 = "numeric",
    input2 = "numeric",
    input3 = "numeric"

  # Set the default values (optional)
  prototype = list(
    input1 = 0.3,
    input2 = 0.3,
    input3 = 0.3
  ),
  
  # Make a function that can test to see if the data is consistent.
  # This is not called if you have an initialize function defined!
